    "This exercise illustrates how to access web-hosted APIs, get back a response in JSONLinks to an external site. format, and extract the information we need from the JSON. Accessing APIs is a key skill for data analysts. We can use web APIs to get stock data, weather data, and much more. We'll use an API to access song lyrics or poems in this exercise. We don't care which API - there are many and they change. The skill skills are being able to (a) make an API request and (b) find the information we need in the returned response. "
